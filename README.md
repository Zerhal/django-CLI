# Django Boilerplate CLI

## Context

This project aims to simplify the creation and initial configuration of a Django project by providing a command-line interface (CLI) written in Rust. The goal is to automate the setup steps of a Django project, allowing developers to save time by avoiding repetitive tasks. This project is designed to be modular, enabling users to select specific features they need during their project setup.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust and flexible CLI for creating Django projects. Users can configure their project according to their specific needs, such as choosing the type of frontend, database, payment system integration, etc. Beyond standard configuration, this CLI allows the addition of features like Django REST Framework integration, user authentication management, and more.

## Features

- **Cross-platform support:** Works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- **Modular Configuration:** Choose the components and features you want to include in your Django project.
- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks during Django project setup.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add new modules or features to the CLI as your needs grow.
