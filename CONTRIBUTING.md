### 4. Submitting Code Changes

If you would like to fix a bug or implement a new feature, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the project.
2. **Create a New Branch:** 
   - Name your branch descriptively, using a prefix such as `feature/` or `bugfix/` (e.g., `feature/add-new-template`).
   - Use a branch name that clearly indicates the purpose of your changes.
3. **Make Your Changes:** Write clear, concise, and well-documented code. Follow the coding guidelines outlined below.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality by running the tests. Add new tests if necessary.
5. **Commit Your Changes:** Write a clear and descriptive commit message. Include a reference to the issue number if applicable (e.g., `Fix #123: Update template generation logic`).
6. **Push to Your Branch:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. **Submit a Pull Request:** 
   - Go to the original repository and submit a pull request (PR) from your branch.
   - In the PR description, provide a detailed explanation of your changes, the issue it addresses, and any relevant context.
   - Link to the issue the PR addresses, if applicable.

### 5. Code Review Process

- **Review:** All pull requests are subject to code review by the maintainers. This helps ensure code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Feedback:** You may receive feedback or requests for changes during the review process. Please address these promptly to move the PR forward.
- **Merge:** Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch. Thank you for your contribution!

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency and quality across the codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Rust Style:** Follow the official Rust [style guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/). Use `rustfmt` to automatically format your code.
- **Modular Code:** Keep code modular and reusable. Avoid hardcoding values and prefer configuration options.
- **Documentation:** Write clear and concise comments, especially for complex logic. Use doc comments (`///`) for public functions and modules.
- **Testing:** Ensure that new features or bug fixes are accompanied by appropriate tests. Use `cargo test` to run tests before submitting your changes.

## Community Guidelines

- **Respect:** Be respectful and considerate in all interactions. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback during code reviews and discussions.
- **Help Others:** If you see someone struggling or in need of help, offer your assistance.
