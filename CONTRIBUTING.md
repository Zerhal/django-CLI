2. **Create a New Branch:** 
   - Name your branch descriptively, using a prefix such as `feature/` or `bugfix/` (e.g., `feature/add-new-template`).
   - Choose a branch name that clearly indicates the purpose of your changes.
3. **Make Your Changes:** Write clear, concise, and well-documented code. Follow the coding guidelines provided below.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure that your changes do not introduce any issues by running tests. Add new tests as necessary to cover your changes.
5. **Commit Your Changes:** Write a clear and descriptive commit message. Include references to issue numbers if applicable (e.g., `Fix #123: Update template generation logic`).
6. **Push to Your Branch:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** 
   - Open a pull request from your branch to the original repository.
   - In the PR description, provide a detailed explanation of your changes, the issue it addresses, and any relevant context.
   - Link to the issue the PR addresses, if applicable.

### 5. Code Review Process

- **Review:** All pull requests undergo a code review by the maintainers to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Feedback:** You may receive feedback or requests for changes during the review process. Please address these promptly to keep the PR moving forward.
- **Merge:** Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch. Thank you for your contribution!

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Rust Style:** Follow the official Rust [style guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/). Use `rustfmt` to automatically format your code before committing.
- **Modular Code:** Write modular and reusable code. Avoid hardcoding values and prefer configurable options whenever possible.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise comments, especially for complex logic. Use doc comments (`///`) for public functions, structs, and modules.
- **Testing:** Accompany new features or bug fixes with appropriate tests. Use `cargo test` to run tests and ensure your code works as expected before submitting.

## Community Guidelines

- **Respect:** Treat everyone with respect and consideration. We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Offer constructive feedback during code reviews and discussions to help improve the project.
- **Support Others:** If you see someone struggling or in need of help, offer your assistance to foster a supportive community.
